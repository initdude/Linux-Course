# Vim Editor Basics

Vim is a highly configurable and powerful text editor that is an enhanced version of the older Vi editor. It is commonly used in Unix-like operating systems, and mastering Vim can significantly boost your productivity when editing text or code.

## Understanding Vim's Modes

Vim operates in several modes, each designed for different tasks:

- **Normal Mode**: This is the default mode for navigating and manipulating text. Most of Vim's powerful commands are executed in this mode.
- **Insert Mode**: In this mode, you can insert or modify text. Enter this mode by pressing `i`, `I`, `a`, `A`, `o`, or `O`.
- **Visual Mode**: Used for selecting text. You can enter visual mode by pressing `v` for character-wise selection or `V` for line-wise selection.
- **Command-Line Mode**: Accessed by pressing `:` in Normal Mode, this mode allows you to execute more complex commands like saving, quitting, and searching.

### Switching Between Modes

- **Normal Mode**: Press `Esc` to switch to Normal Mode from any other mode.
- **Insert Mode**: Press `i` to enter Insert Mode.
- **Visual Mode**: Press `v` to enter Visual Mode.
- **Command-Line Mode**: Press `:` to enter Command-Line Mode.

## Basic Vim Commands

### Opening Vim

To start editing a file with Vim:

```bash

```

If the file does not exist, Vim will create it upon saving.

### Navigating in Normal Mode

- **G**: Move to the end of the file.
- **Ctrl+f**: Scroll down one screen.
- **Ctrl+b**: Scroll up one screen.

### Inserting Text

- **i**: Insert before the cursor.
- **I**: Insert at the beginning of the line.
- **a**: Insert after the cursor.
- **A**: Insert at the end of the line.
- **o**: Open a new line below the current line and enter Insert Mode.
- **O**: Open a new line above the current line and enter Insert Mode.
### Editing Text

- **x**: Delete the character under the cursor.
- **dw**: Delete from the cursor to the start of the next word.
- **dd**: Delete the entire line.
- **u**: Undo the last change.
- **Ctrl+r**: Redo the undone change.
- **p**: Paste text after the cursor.
- **y**: Yank (copy) text.
- **yy**: Yank the current line.
- **P**: Paste text before the cursor.

### Saving and Quitting

- **:w**: Save the file (write changes).
- **:q**: Quit Vim (close the file).
- **:wq**: Save and quit.
- **:q!**: Quit without saving changes.
- **:x**: Save and quit (same as `:wq`).

## Advanced Vim Tips

### Buffers, Windows, and Tabs

- **:e filename**: Open a new file in the current buffer.

- **Ctrl+w**: Switch between split windows.
- **:tabnew filename**: Open a file in a new tab.
- **gt**: Move to the next tab.
- **gT**: Move to the previous tab.

### Working with Registers

Vim allows you to store text in registers for more complex copy-paste operations.

- **"ayy**: Yank a line into register "a".
- **"ap**: Paste the contents of register "a".
- **:reg**: Display the contents of all registers.

### Macros

You can record a sequence of commands and play them back.

- **q followed by a letter**: Start recording a macro into that register.
- **q**: Stop recording.
- **@ followed by a letter**: Play back the macro stored in that register.
- **@@**: Replay the last macro.

## Customizing Vim

Vim is highly customizable through the `~/.vimrc` file. You can add settings, key mappings, and plugins to tailor Vim to your workflow.

### Example `.vimrc`

```vim
" Enable line numbers
set number

" Enable syntax highlighting
syntax on

" Set tabs to 4 spaces
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab

" Enable search highlighting
set hlsearch

" Set file encoding to UTF-8
set encoding=utf-8- **N**: Move to the previous occurrence of the search pattern.
- **:%s/old/new/g**: Replace all occurrences of "old" with "new" in the entire file.
- **:s/old/new/g**: Replace all occurrences of "old" with "new" in the current line.
### Installing Plugins

Vim supports plugins, which can be managed manually or with plugin managers like [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) or [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

Example using Vundle:

1. Add this to your `.vimrc`:

    ```vim
    set nocompatible              " Be iMproved, required
    filetype off                  " Required
    
    " Set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
    set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    call vundle#begin()
    
    " Let Vundle manage Vundle, required
    Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'
    
    " Add more plugins here
    Plugin 'tpope/vim-sensible'
    
    " All of your Plugins must be added before the following line
    call vundle#end()            " Required
    filetype plugin indent on    " Required
    ```

2. Install the plugins:

    ```bash
    vim +PluginInstall +qall
    ```
