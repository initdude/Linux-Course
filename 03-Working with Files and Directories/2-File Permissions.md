File Permissions

File permissions in Linux control who can read, write, and execute files and directories. Understanding and managing these permissions is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your system.
Understanding File Permissions

In Linux, each file and directory has three types of permissions that apply to three categories of users:
Categories of Users

    Owner: The user who owns the file.
    Group: The group that owns the file.
    Others: All other users who are not the owner or part of the group.

Types of Permissions

    Read (r): Allows viewing the contents of a file or listing a directory's contents.
    Write (w): Allows modifying a file's contents or adding/removing files in a directory.
    Execute (x): Allows running a file as a program or entering a directory.
