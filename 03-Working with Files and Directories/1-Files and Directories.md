Understanding Files and Directories
Files

A file in Linux is a collection of data stored on disk. Files can contain text, binary data, or be executable scripts and programs. Each file is identified by a unique name within its directory.
Directories
Directories, also known as folders, are special files that can contain other files and directories. They help organize the file system into a hierarchical structure, making it easier to manage and locate files.
