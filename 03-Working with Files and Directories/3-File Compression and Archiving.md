File Compression and Archiving

In Linux, compressing and archiving files is a common practice to save disk space and organize multiple files into a single archive. This page will introduce the most commonly used tools and commands for file compression and archiving.
Understanding Compression and Archiving
Compression

Compression reduces the size of a file or group of files by encoding the data more efficiently. Compressed files use less disk space and can be transferred more quickly over networks. Common compression formats include .gz, .bz2, and .xz.
Archiving
Archiving involves combining multiple files and directories into a single file, often without compression. This makes it easier to manage and transfer large sets of files. The most common format for archiving in Linux is the tarball (.tar).
