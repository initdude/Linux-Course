Managing Permissions
In Linux, file and directory permissions control access to resources, ensuring that users can only access files and directories they're authorized to. This page will explore how permissions work, how to modify them, and how to manage them effectively.
Understanding Permissions
Permission Types

Each file and directory in Linux has three types of permissions:

    Read (r): Allows viewing the contents of a file or listing the contents of a directory.
    Write (w): Allows modifying the contents of a file or adding/removing files in a directory.
    Execute (x): Allows running a file as a program or accessing a directory.

Permission Categories

Permissions are assigned to three categories:

    Owner: The user who owns the file or directory.
    Group: The group associated with the file or directory.
    Others: All other users on the system.
