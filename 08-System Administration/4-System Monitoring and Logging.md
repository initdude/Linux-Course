    - Useful for historical performance analysis.

### `df` and `du`

- **`df`**: Reports file system disk space usage.
  - **Usage**: 
    ```bash
    df -h
    ```
  - **Key Features**:
    - Shows available and used disk space for all mounted filesystems.

## System Logging with `syslog` and `journalctl`

### `syslog`

- **`syslog`**: A standard for system logging, providing a central location for logging messages from the kernel and various applications.
  - **Configuration**: The configuration file for `syslog` is typically located at `/etc/rsyslog.conf`.
  - **Log Files**:
    - `/var/log/syslog`: General system logs.
    - `/var/log/auth.log`: Authentication logs.
    - `/var/log/kern.log`: Kernel logs.
    - `/var/log/mail.log`: Mail server logs.
    - `/var/log/boot.log`: Boot process logs.

- **Logging Levels**:
  - **emerg**: System is unusable.
  - **alert**: Action must be taken immediately.
  - **crit**: Critical conditions.
  - **err**: Error conditions.
  - **warn**: Warning conditions.
  - **notice**: Normal but significant condition.
  - **info**: Informational messages.
  - **debug**: Debug-level messages.

- **Managing Logs**:
  - **View logs**:
    ```bash
    cat /var/log/syslog
    ```
  - **Filter logs by date**:
    ```bash
    grep "Sep  1" /var/log/syslog
    ```

### `journalctl`

- **`journalctl`**: A command for querying and displaying logs from the systemd journal.
  - **Usage**: 
    ```bash
    journalctl
    ```
  - **Key Features**:
    - Displays logs with real-time updates.
    - Supports advanced filtering by service, time, and log levels.

- **Viewing Boot Logs**:
  - **View logs from the current boot**:
    ```bash
    journalctl -b
    ```
  - **View logs from the previous boot**:
    ```bash
    journalctl -b -1
    ```

- **Filtering Logs**:
  - **Filter by service**:
    ```bash
    journalctl -u sshd
    ```
  - **Filter by time**:
    ```bash
    journalctl --since "2024-09-01 00:00:00" --until "2024-09-02 00:00:00"
    ```

- **Persistent Logging**:
  - By default, `journalctl` logs are stored in memory. To make them persistent:
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /var/log/journal
    sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
    ```

## Monitoring and Logging Best Practices

### Set Up Log Rotation

To prevent log files from consuming too much disk space, set up log rotation using `logrotate`.

- **Configuration**: Log rotation settings are defined in `/etc/logrotate.conf` and additional files in `/etc/logrotate.d/`.
- **Example Configuration**:
    ```bash
    /var/log/syslog {
        rotate 7
        daily
        missingok
        notifempty
        delaycompress
        compress
        postrotate
            /etc/init.d/rsyslog reload > /dev/null
        endscript
    }
    ```

### Regular Monitoring

Regularly monitor your system using tools like `top`, `htop`, and `df` to ensure your system is running smoothly and to catch potential issues early.

### Secure Your Logs

Ensure that your logs are secured by setting appropriate permissions and restricting access to authorized users only. Regularly back up logs to prevent data loss.
