# Redirections

Redirection in Linux allows you to control where the output of a command goes and where the input for a command comes from. This is a fundamental aspect of shell scripting and command-line operations, enabling users to connect and manipulate data streams efficiently.

This page will cover the basics of standard input/output (I/O), redirection operators, and how to combine them with pipes to perform powerful data manipulations.

## Standard Input, Output, and Error

In Linux, commands use three standard data streams:

1. **Standard Input (`stdin`)**: The data stream that provides input to commands, usually from the keyboard. By default, it is file descriptor `0`.
   
2. **Standard Output (`stdout`)**: The data stream where a command sends its output, usually to the terminal screen. By default, it is file descriptor `1`.
   
3. **Standard Error (`stderr`)**: The data stream where a command sends its error messages, also usually to the terminal screen. By default, it is file descriptor `2`.

## Redirecting Standard Output (`>` and `>>`)

Redirecting output is one of the most common forms of redirection.

### Basic Redirection (`>`)

- **Redirect Output to a File**:

    ```bash
    command > file.txt
    ```

    This command sends the output to `file.txt`, overwriting it if the file exists.

### Append Output (`>>`)

- **Append Output to a File**:

    ```bash
    command >> file.txt
    ```

    This command appends the output to `file.txt` without overwriting the existing content.

## Redirecting Standard Input (`<`)

Redirecting input allows a command to take input from a file instead of the keyboard.

- **Use a File as Input**:

    ```bash
    command < file.txt
    ```

    This feeds the contents of `file.txt` as input to the command.

## Redirecting Standard Error (`2>`)

Sometimes you may want to separate error messages from normal output.

- **Redirect Errors to a File**:

    ```bash
    command 2> error.log
    ```

    This sends error messages to `error.log` instead of the terminal.

## Combining Standard Output and Error (`>&` and `2>&1`)

You can combine standard output and standard error into a single stream.

- **Redirect Both Output and Errors to the Same File**:

    ```bash
    command > file.txt 2>&1
    ```

    This sends both the standard output and standard error to `file.txt`.

- **Redirect Output and Error Separately**:

    ```bash
    command > output.txt 2> error.log
    ```

    This sends standard output to `output.txt` and errors to `error.log`.

## Using Pipes (`|`)

Pipes allow you to use the output of one command as the input for another.

- **Basic Pipe Usage**:

    ```bash
    command1 | command2
    ```

    This takes the output of `command1` and uses it as the input for `command2`.

### Example: Using Pipes with Redirection

- **Search for a Word in a File and Count Occurrences**:

    ```bash
    grep "word" file.txt | wc -l
    ```

    This command finds all occurrences of "word" in `file.txt` and then counts the number of matching lines.

## Here Documents (`<<`)

A here document is a type of redirection that allows you to pass a block of text as input to a command.

- **Using a Here Document**:

    ```bash
    command << EOF
    Line 1
    Line 2
    EOF
    ```

    Everything between the two `EOF` markers is treated as input to `command`.

## Here Strings (`<<<`)

A here string is similar to a here document but allows you to pass a single string as input.

- **Using a Here String**:

    ```bash
    command <<< "This is a single input string"
    ```

    This passes the string "This is a single input string" as input to `command`.
