# Common Text Processing Tools

Linux provides a wide array of text processing tools that are essential for handling and manipulating text files. These tools are frequently used in scripting, data processing, and system administration tasks.

This page will cover several common text processing tools including `awk`, `sed`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `cut`, and `paste`.

## `awk`: Pattern Scanning and Processing Language

`awk` is a powerful text processing tool used for pattern scanning and processing. It operates on rows of text, making it ideal for working with structured data.

### Basic Usage

- **Print Specific Columns**:

    ```bash
    awk '{print $1, $3}' filename
    ```

    This command prints the first and third columns from each line of `filename`.

- **Filter and Process Data**:

    ```bash
    awk '$3 > 50 {print $1, $3}' filename
    ```

    This command prints the first and third columns only for rows where the third column is greater than 50.

- **Field Separator**:

    ```bash
    awk -F ',' '{print $1, $2}' filename
    ```

    This uses a comma as the field separator (useful for CSV files).

## `sed`: Stream Editor for Transforming Text

While `sed` is also covered under filters, itâ€™s one of the most versatile text processing tools, making it worthy of a deeper look.

### Basic Usage

- **Substitute Text**:

    ```bash
    sed 's/oldword/newword/' filename
    ```

    This substitutes the first occurrence of `oldword` with `newword` in each line.

- **Delete Lines**:

    ```bash
    sed '/pattern/d' filename
    ```

    This deletes lines that match the pattern.

- **Insert Text**:

    ```bash
    sed '2i\This is a new line' filename
    ```

    This inserts a new line of text after the second line.
