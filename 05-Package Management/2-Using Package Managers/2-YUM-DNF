# YUM/DNF (RHEL/CentOS)

YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) and DNF (Dandified YUM) are the primary package management tools for Red Hat-based distributions, including RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora. While DNF is the successor to YUM and is used in more recent releases, YUM is still prevalent in older systems.

## Understanding YUM and DNF

### YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)

YUM is a command-line package management utility that handles software installation, updates, and removal for `.rpm` packages. It also manages dependencies and can work with various repositories.

### DNF (Dandified YUM)

DNF is the modern replacement for YUM, introduced to address performance, dependency resolution, and memory usage issues. It is backward-compatible with YUM, meaning it can perform the same functions with improved efficiency.

### Key Differences Between YUM and DNF

- **Performance**: DNF is faster and uses less memory than YUM.
- **Dependency Resolution**: DNF provides better handling of dependencies.
- **Plugin System**: DNF has a more flexible and improved plugin system.
- **Command Syntax**: Most YUM commands are compatible with DNF, but DNF introduces some new options and enhancements.
