# YUM/DNF (RHEL/CentOS)

YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) and DNF (Dandified YUM) are the primary package management tools for Red Hat-based distributions, including RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora. While DNF is the successor to YUM and is used in more recent releases, YUM is still prevalent in older systems.

## Understanding YUM and DNF

### YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)

YUM is a command-line package management utility that handles software installation, updates, and removal for `.rpm` packages. It also manages dependencies and can work with various repositories.

### DNF (Dandified YUM)

DNF is the modern replacement for YUM, introduced to address performance, dependency resolution, and memory usage issues. It is backward-compatible with YUM, meaning it can perform the same functions with improved efficiency.

### Key Differences Between YUM and DNF

- **Performance**: DNF is faster and uses less memory than YUM.
- **Dependency Resolution**: DNF provides better handling of dependencies.
- **Plugin System**: DNF has a more flexible and improved plugin system.
- **Command Syntax**: Most YUM commands are compatible with DNF, but DNF introduces some new options and enhancements.

## Basic YUM/DNF Commands

### Installing Packages

To install a package with YUM:
```bash
sudo yum install package-name
```

With DNF, the command is similar:

```bash
sudo dnf install package-name
```

Example:

```bash
sudo dnf install httpd
```

### Updating Packages

To update all installed packages:

```bash
sudo yum update
```

Or with DNF:

```bash
sudo dnf upgrade
```

### Removing Packages

To remove a package:

```bash
sudo yum remove package-name
```

Or with DNF:

```bash
sudo dnf remove package-name
```

Example:

```bash
sudo dnf remove nginx
```
### Searching for Packages

To search for a package by name or description:

```bash
yum search package-name
```

Or with DNF:

```bash
dnf search package-name
```

Example:

```bash
dnf search mysql
```

### Viewing Package Information

To display detailed information about a package:

```bash
yum info package-name
```

Or with DNF:

```bash
dnf info package-name
```

Example:

```bash
dnf info vim
```

### Listing Installed Packages

To list all installed packages:

```bash
yum list installed
```

Or with DNF:

```bash
dnf list installed
```

### Cleaning Up

After installing or updating packages, you might want to clean up the package cache to free up disk space:

```bash
sudo yum clean all
```

Or with DNF:

```bash
sudo dnf clean all
```
